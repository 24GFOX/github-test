#summary Omaha allows administrators to control how and when Omaha updates applications.

= Overview =
Omaha allows administrators to control how and when Omaha updates applications. See the [http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/05/google-update-releases-update-controls.html announcement] on the Open Source Blog. The documentation for administrators is in the [http://www.google.com/support/installer/go/enterprise Google Update for Enterprise documentation].

= Implementation =
Omaha's Group Policy support is implemented by reading the appropriate [http://www.google.com/support/installer/go/enterprise#Registry_Settings registry settings] from {{{HKLM\Software\Policies\Google\Update}}} when performing specific actions. For example, when determining whether it should do an update check, Omaha attempts to read {{{AutoUpdateCheckPeriodMinutes}}}. If found, that value is used instead of the default value for the comparison with (now - {{{LastChecked}}}).

The Administrative Template is automatically generated for all [http://www.google.com/support/installer/bin/answer.py?answer=146158 supported applications] by scripts in the [http://code.google.com/p/omaha/source/browse/#svn/trunk/enterprise enterprise] directory.
