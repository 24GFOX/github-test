#summary Instructions for how to set up a build environment for Omaha

= Introduction =

These instructions are intended to assist the would-be Omaha developer with setting up an environment in which to successfully build the Omaha source code.


= Required Downloads =

The following packages are required to build Omaha:
  * Omaha source code
    * You can either:
      * Download a full source package from the [http://code.google.com/p/omaha/downloads/list Downloads area].
      * See *this* wiki page for setting up access to the subversion repository
  * Microsoft Visual C++
    * You will need to have at least the Standard Edition of Visual C or Visual Studio. (Note: the Express Editions are not sufficient, because they do not include ATL/MFC, which Omaha requires.)
  * Microsoft Vista SDK
    * You can get the SDK from [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4377f86d-c913-4b5c-b87e-ef72e5b4e065&displaylang=en here].
  * WTL
    * You can get WTL from [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1be1eb52-aa96-4685-99a5-4256737781c5&displaylang=en here].
  * Python 2.4 or greater (but not Python 3 or above!)
    * Download Python from [http://www.python.org/download/ here].


= Details =

Once the above packages have been downloaded and installed, the following steps are required prior to building:
  * Create the following environment variables:
    * %MSVCDIR% - set this to the root of the Visual C directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC`)
    * %SDKDIR% - set to the root of the Vista SDK directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\PlatformSDK`)
    * %ATLMFCDIR% - set to the root of the ATL/MFC directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC`)
    * %WTLDIR% - set to the root of the WTL directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files\WTL`)
  * Make sure the directory containing python.exe is in your %PATH%

Once the above setup is complete:
  # Open a fresh cmd.exe window (if you're running under Vista, make sure cmd.exe is running as Administrator)
  # Navigate to the 'Omaha-Base' directory, which is the root directory of the installed Omaha source code.
  # From the above directory, just type `hammer` to build Omaha! (Note: more advanced Hammer options can be found [http://code.google.com/p/omaha/wiki/HammerOptions here].)
